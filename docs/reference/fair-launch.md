# Fair Launch Declaration

Drachma begins with no premine, no founder rewards, and no special distribution phases. Mining starts at block 1 with the standard 10 DRM subsidy and the normal difficulty adjustment schedule. The genesis coinbase is unspendable by design, ensuring no hidden allocation exists.

All participants follow the same consensus rules:
- SHA-256d proof-of-work
- 60-second target block time
- 2,102,400-block halving interval (~4 years)
- 42,000,000 DRM maximum supply

No checkpoints, admin keys, or governance mechanisms are present. Network bootstrapping relies on public seeds and standard block validation.
