# DRACHMA Project Roadmap

A phased plan for delivering the DRACHMA blockchain with transparency and predictable milestones.

## Current Focus
- Finalizing Layer 1 consensus validation and fork-choice hardening.
- Strengthening P2P, mempool, and wallet services for adversarial networks.
- Completing the desktop user interface for node control, wallet operations, and miner configuration.

## Short-Term (Next Phase)
- Launch public testnet with seed nodes, explorer endpoints, and faucet support.
- Expand fuzzing/integration coverage and publish updated threat models.
- Produce reproducible release builds for early operators.

## Medium-Term
- Conduct external security audits for consensus, networking, wallet, and miner code.
- Deliver optimized CPU/GPU miners with documented pool/solo settings and DoS protections.
- Draft operational hardening guidance (`deployment.md`) and operator runbooks.

## Long-Term
- Execute a fair mainnet launch with transparent participation criteria and public seed lists.
- Release a public block explorer with real-time network and economic metrics.
- Maintain a regular documentation cadence and post-launch monitoring plan without governance keys.
